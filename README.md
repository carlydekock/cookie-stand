# LAB - 10

## Salmon Cookies
Website for Pat's salmon cookie stores. Sales tab shows a table of sales per hour at each of the five salmon cookies stores during opening hours of 6am-8pm. It also includes a form for user input for new stores and adds another row to the table. Home page includes info about the business and photos of products.

### Reflections and Comments:
- Dec 7: Built the object literals for each of the salmon cookies stores. Built functions to generate random numbers of customers, calculate hourly sales, and sum of total sales for each store. Output values into a list on sales.html page. 
- Dec 8: Replaced all object literals with a single constructor function. Replaced lists of data for each store into a single table of data.
- Dec 9: Worked on styling of the site per instructions in lab08b. This might have been the most frustrating and challenging part for me so far. Lots of hours spent with little to show for it.
- Dec 10: Added form to the sales page, allowing for user input of details for new stores (name, customer minimum, customer maximum, and average cookie sales). This was a bit easier today to implement, and I had an easier time styling the form and the table than the rest of the page.
- Dec 11: Finished off styling, added fonts and text coloring per instructions for lab. Also added different background colors for parts of the page. Fixed error in table rendering to specify input as numbers instead of text. Worked on drying out JavaScript code per ideas discussed in class during code review.
