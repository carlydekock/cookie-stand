### Assets:
- Used this for math.random: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round
- Used this for reference on HTML tables: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp

### Reflections and Comments:
- Dec 8: Built the object literals for each of the salmon cookies stores. Built functions to generate random numbers of customers, calculate hourly sales, and sum of total sales for each store. Output values into a list on sales.html page. 
- Dec 9: Replaced all object literals with a single constructor function. Replaced lists of data for each store into a single table of data.
